# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

This article is meant for everyone to understand because the drop in Kenya's elephant numbers affects us all. Here's why it's aimed at the general public:

1. Raising Awareness: We want everyone to know about the big problem of fewer elephants in Kenya. By sharing this information, we hope to help people understand why it's important to care about this issue.

2. Impact on Communities: When elephants decline, it doesn't just affect the animals. It also affects the people living near them. This article talks about how it can hurt local jobs and businesses that depend on tourists who come to see these animals.

3. Encouraging Support: If more people know about the things causing the decline, like poaching and losing their homes, we can work together to make changes. This might mean supporting new rules or working with other countries to stop illegal trading.

4. Making Better Choices: Sometimes, people buy things made from elephants without realizing it hurts them. We want to teach people that these choices can have a big impact, so they can make better decisions.

5. Feeling Connected: Elephants are special animals. When we talk about how poaching hurts them and their families, we hope it helps people feel more connected and want to help.

6. Easy to Understand: We're writing this in a way that's easy for everyone to read and understand. We don't want to use difficult words that might confuse people.
