1.The Decline in Elephant Numbers in Kenya

The precipitous decline in Kenya's elephant population has raised significant concerns and generated numerous pressing questions among conservationists, scientists, and policymakers. Over the last few decades, the once-thriving elephant population has seen a staggering decrease, prompting critical inquiries into the reasons behind this distressing trend.

The magnitude of the Decline:
Data from the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and conservation groups reveal a disturbing reality - the decline in elephant numbers from an estimated 167,000 in the 1970s to just around 34,000 in recent years. This significant drop has triggered alarm bells, leading to an urgent need for comprehensive investigation and action.

Factors Contributing to the Decline:
Several factors have been identified as contributing to the decline in Kenya's elephant population. These include habitat loss due to human encroachment, fragmentation of ecosystems, and retaliatory killings due to human-elephant conflicts. Additionally, the illegal wildlife trade, especially the poaching of elephants for their tusks, remains a predominant cause.

Impact on Ecosystems and Communities:
The decline in elephant numbers has repercussions beyond the species itself. Elephants play a crucial role in shaping and maintaining ecosystems, and their decline can disrupt the balance of flora and fauna. Furthermore, communities relying on wildlife-based tourism, a significant economic driver in Kenya, face adverse consequences due to the dwindling elephant population.

2.Poaching Contributes to Elephant Population Decline

Background on Poaching:
Poaching, driven by the demand for ivory in global markets, remains one of the foremost threats to elephant populations not only in Kenya but across Africa. Despite international bans on ivory trade, the illicit demand persists, fueling a lucrative black market and incentivizing poachers to kill elephants for their tusks.

Poaching Statistics:
Statistics from wildlife conservation organizations illustrate the gravity of the situation. In Kenya, tens of thousands of elephants have fallen victim to poaching in recent years, with a notable surge in illegal killings during periods of heightened demand for ivory.

Impact of Poaching:
Poaching not only diminishes elephant numbers but also disrupts social structures within elephant herds, as well as the broader ecosystem. The loss of mature elephants, often targeted by poachers for their larger tusks, has detrimental effects on herd dynamics, breeding patterns, and the transfer of knowledge within elephant communities.

3.Future Strategies to Save Elephants

Anti-Poaching Measures:
To combat poaching, various measures have been implemented, including increased patrols, technological advancements like drones and GPS tracking, community involvement in conservation, and stiffer penalties for wildlife crimes. These efforts aim to deter poachers and disrupt illegal ivory supply chains.

Technology and Innovation:
Harnessing technological advancements, such as satellite tracking, DNA analysis, and artificial intelligence, can significantly aid conservation efforts. These tools enhance monitoring capabilities, facilitate rapid response to poaching incidents, and enable better understanding of elephant behavior and migration patterns.

International Collaboration and Policy Advocacy:
Collaboration among countries, along with stringent enforcement of existing wildlife protection laws, is imperative. International cooperation can combat transnational wildlife crime networks and reduce the demand for ivory through advocacy, education, and diplomatic efforts.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.

For the first part, I will briefly explain to the audience to quickly understand the main content of this research. I don't want to include too much detailed data in this section to affect the viewer's experience. I will mainly use a line chart or bar chart and show the map to let the audience locate the place where things happen.

For the second part, I will use storytelling to explain to the audience why these things happen. Use detailed data to tell them why. I will mainly use a line chart or bar chart.

For the third part, I will present the improvements people are already making and their results. I will mainly use a line chart or bar chart.

For the initial sketches, I will use the iPad to draw them quickly to determine if they are usable.

For the final solution, I will use Shorthand and Tableau.
