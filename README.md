# Xiaofan-portfolio

# About me
Hi! I used to work as a CAD designer. I like design. And I like visualizations. 

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. Color matching
2. Reduce useless information
3. Readability

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)

## Final project

[Final project I](final-project-part-one)
My topic is the dramatic decline in African elephant populations. I scour the data to compare elephant populations in Africa decades ago with those now, and I'll lay out the reasons for this. I mainly want to express to the audience the harm of poaching to elephants.

[Final project II](final-project-part-two)
I created better data visualizations and listed more comparative data. I focused on poaching. Hopefully, people will pay attention to the impact of poaching on elephants. Finally, we call on people to boycott the ivory trade.

[Final project III](final-project-part-three)
