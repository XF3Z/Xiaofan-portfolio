# Xiaofan-portfolio

# About me
Hi! I used to work as a CAD designer. I really like design.  And I like visualizations. 

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. Color matching
2. Reduce useless information
3. Readability
