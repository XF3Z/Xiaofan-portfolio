# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.
> 
Based on the suggestions made by the audience and professors, I made the following changes in part 3:

1. I changed the story structure of the article to make the story flow more smoothly. Improve the entire article by asking questions, discovering causes, and proposing solutions.
2. I used new data visualizations. In Part 2, my visualization was too single. In Part 3, I used a variety of visualizations to enrich the content.
3. I added sources of citations for the article data to avoid plagiarism.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

The intended audience for this data story and analysis leans heavily toward policymakers involved in environmental conservation and wildlife protection at both national and international levels. Policymakers play a pivotal role in formulating and implementing regulations that could directly impact the conservation efforts aimed at mitigating the ongoing crisis of elephant poaching and the illegal ivory trade. The comprehensive insights provided in this article, ranging from the alarming statistics regarding the decline in elephant populations to the multifaceted causes of this issue, are crucial for policymakers to understand the urgency and complexity of the situation. The article emphasizes the need for robust anti-poaching measures, technological advancements for better monitoring and protection, as well as the significance of international collaboration and policy changes. To tailor the information for policymakers, the article accentuates the interconnectedness between the decline in elephant populations, ecosystem disruption, economic repercussions in wildlife-based tourism, and the global demand for ivory. The focus on a multi-pronged approach underscores the necessity for policymakers to adopt comprehensive strategies that encompass law enforcement, technology integration, community involvement, and global cooperation to effectively combat the ivory trade and protect endangered species like elephants. The language and framing of the information aim to educate policymakers, urging them to take decisive actions and implement policies that can address the root causes of the crisis while safeguarding the future of elephants and their ecosystems.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

In the future if I get a chance to improve my final project. I hope to find more complete data. At this stage, much data is incomplete. I wish I could have continuous data documenting elephant poaching and the ivory trade. I can make better data visualizations when I have complete data. The part that excites me the most is trying to gain the audience’s attention through storytelling. I really like this way of making the final project. This course helped me a lot.
